# Designing-Optimal-Trade
This project designs a single trade using quantitative reasoning and single-variable calculus. Each decision is framed as an optimization problem, balancing reward, cost, and risk. Trade intuition is converted into objective functions, and derivatives are used to justify optimal parameters step by step.
